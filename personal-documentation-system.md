# Personal documentation system
date: 2024-05-03

As Simon Sinek says, start with ...

## Why?
I want to share how I document any findings and how I go about remembering things that matter.

What I like about this system is that it's independent of what operating system you use, these tools are multi platform and I've tested them in various scenarios.

Portable, reproducable, light enough that it doesn't require specialized or expensive software.

## How?
it starts with the tools being used, for this to work you need some kind of shell. im using bash and zsh, but this works on MSYS bash as well.

You need a terminal, if you need pictures in the terminal you can try Wezterm, I use Alacrity that runs on any Operating system.
